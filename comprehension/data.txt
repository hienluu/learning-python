Morning Routine Coffee steam rises, Bitter beans wake up the soul, Monday starts again.
2. Digital Drift Pixels on the screen, Glowing blue in midnight air, Sleep is far away.
3. Desert Silence Golden sand shifts slow, Cactus shadows stretch and lean, Dry wind whispers soft.
4. Binary Logic Zeroes and ones dance, Logic gates open and close, Current finds a way.
5. City Rain Tires splash on street, Neon lights blur in the mist, Grey clouds hold the sky.
